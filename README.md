Cinnamon is an open-source framework by the [MagenTys](http://magentys.io) team which is designed to provide an easy to use java test automation framework for your integration and acceptance tests. 
It supports behaviour driven development (BDD), provides a quick start page object model, a more robust and easy to use abstraction layer over selenium webdriver and other utilities to help test.
