## What is Cinnamon?
Cinnamon provides fast enablement on your automation projects. You can mix and match various modules depending on your requirements.

Cinnamon exposes the following modules:

* `cinnamon-webdriver`
* `cinnamon-vendor-saucelabs`
* `cinnamon-vendor-browserstack`
* `cinnamon-cucumber`

And utilises internally :

* `cinnamon-core`
* `cinnamon-webdriver-factory`
* `cinnamon-vendor-support`

It provides an archetype for project creation: `cinnamon-archetype` and examples of usage can be found at `cinnamon-acceptance-test`

## Why Cinnamon?
As a company, we have faced many challenges with tooling across many clients in various sectors. Solutions to these challenges have been incorporated
into Cinnamon over many years. We have decided to share the most commonly used modules with the community so that you don't have to worry about
solving them yourself.

## Roadmap

We are currently working towards:
* reinstating support for appium
* adding support for Rest
* adding standard web and rest cherry missions
* custom Hamcrest matchers

We have plans to support:
* junit
* jbehave
